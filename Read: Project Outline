Im currently runing an ASIC crpyto mining farm ($Kaspa) consisting of 6 IceRiver ks0 pro's

I dislike the basic dashboard, and plan to have a self sustaining for:
  caluclating acctual cost, acctual income, a live income display, and charted changes
  along with easy configurations of overclocks, technicly possibly and automatic overclocking
  feature, though, that would be VERY far down the line.
Navigaing all the diffent IP's, while simple enough, is ineffictient if I only need to see
  a fe numbers, so I started making something right away. Currently on its 5th revision/update.

With a goal of complete conectivity! So I can be alterted, and alter paramaters while outside
of my home network. As long as I have celular data, I have access to everything, however I 
plan to change this to a simple domain with user logins, and an easy-to-use, however modern
dashboard for people wanting a simmilar thing.

I understand this is a very personalized project, though I do hope that my work can make
the live of others easier. Feel free to ask questions through my email on my account page.
