Im currently runing an ASIC farm consisting of 6 IceRiver ks0 pro's

I dislike the basic dashboard, and plan to have a self sustaining for:
  caluclating acctual cost, acctual income, a live income display, and charted changes
  along with easy configurations of overclocks, technicly possibly and automatic overclocking
  feature, though, that would be VERY far down the line.
With a goal of complete conectivity! So I can be alterted, and alter paramaters while outside
of my home network. As long as I have celular data, I have access to everything, however I 
plan to change this to a simple domain with user logins, and an easy-to-use, however modern
dashboard for people wanting a simmilar thing.

I understand this is a very personalized project, though I do hope that my work can make
the live of others easier. Feel free to ask questions through my email on my account page.
